# CAFM: A 3D Morphable Model for Animals

We present Cat-like Animals Facial Model (CAFM) -- a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) constructed from 50 samples, including lion, tiger, puma, American Shorthair, Abyssinian cat, etc. To the best of our knowledge, CAFM is the first animal morphable model ever constructed. 

The constructed cat-like animal face dataset is released at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ar_Wi6QpXxixJiIw_Qju5OWJStAb4TCv?usp=sharing) containing pairs of 2D face images with 15 landmarks and 3D face meshes with projection parameters.
